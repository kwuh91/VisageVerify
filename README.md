## About

VisageVerify is a mobile application built with SwiftUI, a passion project that combines original handmade designs, animations, facial recognition technology, QR code integration, and more.

## Features

- **Experimental interactive interface:** interesting and mesmerizing design.
- **Face recognition:** You don't have to store all those passwords and logins, the only thing you need is your face!
- **Customizable Themes:** Personalize the app to suit your style.
